* I received my M.S. degree in Computer Engineering at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/). My academic advisor is [Prof. Yanzhi Wang](http://www.ece.neu.edu/people/wang-yanzhi).
* I received my B.S. degree in Computer Engineering at [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu/)
* My research interests lie in the more efficient Deep learning and Artificial
Intelligence System. I have been deeply involved in algorithm-hardware co-design. My goal is to ensure efficiency, stability, and security of deploying Deep Neural Networks in chips.
