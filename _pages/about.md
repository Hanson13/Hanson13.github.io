I am currently applying for PhD in Computer Science. My objective is to build highly efficient, secure, stable Artificial Intelligent Systems. So far, I have been deeply involved with algorithm-hadware co-design to ensure that Deep Neural Networks can be applied in 
resource limited platforms, for example, in chips. While my work in building a training framework that utilizes ADMM(Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) achieves state-of-art in both reducing weight redundancy and bit representation redundancy in weights, I continue to ask whether model compression affect models' robustness in both <b>application domain</b>(transfer learning and generability) and <b>adversarial domain</b> (robustness to adversarial attacks).

During my PhD study, I also like to rise above and answer a more important question: whether we can provide interpretability in this generation of AI systems. I believe discoveries in neural science will also be helpful.
